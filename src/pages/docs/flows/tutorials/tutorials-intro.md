To get started with Postman Flows, make sure you have some API requests in your workspace, so you can use them in your flows. See [Grouping requests in collections]("/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/") for more info.

Flows are located in the left sidebar. Click **Flows** to see your flows.

## Creating a flow

You can create a new flow from the left sidebar in Postman. Select __New__, then select **Flows**.

This opens a new canvas, containing a start block and a connected block list. You can then select a next block in your flow.

<!--TODO: screenshot -->

Rename your flow by clicking the name in the top row of the tab. You can delete flows by selecting <img alt="Three dots icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg" width="18px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:5px"> and then **Delete**.

## Adding and connecting blocks

Click **Add Block**

You can connect individual blocks simply by dragging an output port from one block to the input port of another block:

(dotted line vs solid)

All the important configurations a block needs to work successfully can be done within the block. Choose a block and configure based on what you want to achieve.

## Running a flow

The first block of your flow is a start block. After you've added and connected blocks, click the start block to run the flow. You can also click the start button at the bottom of the canvas.
