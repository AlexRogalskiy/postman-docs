A mock server simulates the behavior of a real API by returning predefined data in response to different scenarios. Create a new mock server to develop or test against an API before it's production ready or without using production data.

Postman provides several ways to create a mock server. Create a mock server from scratch to define all the endpoints and scenarios yourself, or use a template to create a fully-configured mock server and start using it right away. You can also create a mock server from a collection, an API, or the Postman History.

> You must be signed into a Postman account to create a mock server.

## Creating a mock server from scratch

Select the **Create from scratch** option to create an empty mock server. You can define endpoint stubs and scenarios as needed to simulate or test your API.

1. Select **Mock Servers** in the sidebar and select **+**.
1. Select **Create from scratch** and select **Create Mock Server**.

> When you create a mock server from scratch, Postman also creates a new, empty collection for the mock server.

## Creating a mock server using a template

Select the **Use a template** option to create a mock server based on a predefined template. You can select from a variety of mock server templates designed for UI testing, simulating server responses, and more. Your new mock server is fully configured, so you can begin using it right away or customize it as needed.

1. Select **Mock Servers** in the sidebar and select **+**.
1. Select **Use a template** and select the template you want to use.
1. Select **Create Mock Server**.

> When you create a mock server from a template, Postman also creates a new collection with predefined requests for the mock server. Depending on the template, Postman may also created an environment for the mock server.

## Creating a mock server using a collection

Select the **Use a collection** option to create a mock server based on an existing collection in your current workspace. You can then use the mock server to simulate or test each of the endpoints in your collection.

1. Select **Mock Servers** in the sidebar and select **+**.
1. Select **Use a collection** and select the collection you want to use.
1. (Optional) Select the checkbox to save the mock server URL as an environment variable. Postman will create a new environment with a **url** variable that is set to the URL of the new mock server.
1. Select **Create Mock Server**.

## Creating a mock server from an API

If you want to generate a mocks collection from an API or add a mock to an API collection:

1. Open an API version from __APIs__ in the sidebar.

1. On the API version **Overview** tab, next to **Mock Servers**, select **+** and choose **Create new mock server** or **Add existing mock server**.

    * **Create new mock server:** Select a method for how to base your mock server:

      * **Generate from API schema**: To create a mock server based on a collection generated from your schema, enter a collection name, and configure how the collection will be generated by selecting **Show advanced settings**. Select **Generate Collection and Continue**, and then configure [mock details](#configuring-mock-details).
      * **Use an existing collection**: Select a collection from the dropdown list. Select **Select Collection and Continue**, and then configure [mock details](#configuring-mock-details).
      * **Create a new collection**: Enter the requests your collection will contain. Select **Create Collection and Continue**, and then configure [mock details](#configuring-mock-details).

    * **Add existing mock server:** Select an existing mock server in the list, and then select **Add Mock Server**.

## Creating a mock server from the History

You can build a mock based on requests from your Postman history. In __History__ on the left, hover over a request or date and select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> __> Mock Request__.
