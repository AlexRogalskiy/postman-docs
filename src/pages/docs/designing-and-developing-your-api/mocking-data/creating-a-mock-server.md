A mock server simulates the behavior of a real API by returning predefined data in response to different scenarios. Create a new mock server to develop or test against an API before it's production ready or without using production data.

Postman provides several ways to create a mock server. Create a mock server from scratch to define all of the endpoints and scenarios yourself, or use a template to create a fully configured mock server and start using it right away. You can also create a mock server from a collection, an API, or the Postman History.
