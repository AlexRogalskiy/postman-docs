You can create collections to use as test suites, integration tests, or contract tests for your API. These collections can be linked to a specific version of your API. You can also integrate your API with supported Continuous Integration (CI) tools.

* [Adding tests](#adding-tests)
* [Adding CI integration](#adding-ci-integration)

## Adding tests

You can connect a test collection to an API version you have defined in the Postman API Builder. In the **Test** tab, next to **Tests**, select **Add Test**.

You can add a new or existing test:

* **Create new test**: Enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by choosing **Show advanced settings**, and select **Create Test**.
* **Add existing test**: Choose an available collection from the list and select **Add Test**. You will only see available collections in the list.

## Adding CI integration

Postman integrates with some of the most widely-used Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools. After you set up CI integration for your API, you can view the status of builds or kick off a new build, all from within Postman. You can also run API tests created in Postman as part of your CI pipeline.

To set up CI integration, go to **API > Test > Connect to CI/CD Builds** and select the integration you want to add. To learn more about how CI integrations work, and for detailed configuration steps, see [CI integrations](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/).
